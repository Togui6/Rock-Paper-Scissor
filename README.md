# Rock-Paper-Scissor

What I learned doing this exercise :

1) Assigning values to variables, numbers or strings
2) Creating a random number between 1, 2 and 3. Then converting each of those numbers to a string
3) Using the if, else if, and else statements
4) Creating functions
5) Creating functions parameters as other functions, allowing a function to use two function automatically at the beggining
6) Using &&, ||, =, and ===
7) If using console.log returns a value but "undefined" as well, then it's normal, no problem
8) To make a value case insensitive by converting it to lowercase

What I learned the second time : 
1) Creating events on click
2) Displaying a score with ``(backticks)
3) Creating new elements in the DOM from JS and modifying them
